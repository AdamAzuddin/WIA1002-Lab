My name is Adam Azuddin with matrix number, 23002641. I am
majoring in AI. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this
subject. This is because I've been wanting to learn about data structure and their application in real world programming problem.
I acquired B+ for my previous Programming 1 course. Its not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get an A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will do all the tutorial and lab as early as possible and ask for help whenever I'm stuck. Wish me luck!!!

It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished.

I think I did an amazing job, getting an A+ for this course is definitely a pleasant surprise
